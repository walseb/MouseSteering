Mouse Steering Controller is a Rust application that enables mouse input to control gamepad inputs, emulating an Xbox 360 controller. This project allows users to steer using their mouse position and includes throttle control with configurable settings for smooth or snap-based input behavior. A small visualization window shows real-time input feedback for steering and throttle.

# Installation
This package requires the [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases) drivers to function.
